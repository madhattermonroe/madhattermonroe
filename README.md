## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Pavel, a backend developer from Moscow, Russia.<br />
In my free time, out of pure enthusiasm, I develop applications and plugins, trying to immerse myself in new technologies -> _A kind of hello world in a new programming language in order to push the boundaries of consciousness._

## About Me
* In past Performance Testing Engineer
* Transition to backend developer in 2020
* Team leading since 2022
* Love reading and learning about vulnerability and cybersecurity in general
